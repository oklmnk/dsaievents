Please make sure to register using the General Assembly event page, linked here: <a href="https://ga.co/2PPoZWd" class="linkified">https://ga.co/2PPoZWd</a></p> <p>****<br/>Abstract:<br/>There has been a lot of attention in the media surrounding the rise of automation. As advanced technologies such as robotic process automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have matured, companies have found practical applications to these new technologies.</p> <p>As part of this evolution, Intelligent Automation has become a topic of interest for business leaders across industries looking to combine cognitive capabilities with robotic process technologies to create a "living" system that can go beyond mundane and repeatable tasks. This is extremely advantageous to any organization that can implement these systems seamlessly but there is still a delta between the ideation of AI integration. and the ability to put these plans into effect. This delta can instill fear and anxiety around using AI as well as the added question of the ethical implications of AI such as Facial Recognition and targeted advertising.</p> <p>Join General Assembly and the Data Science Breakfast Meetup as we present a panel of experts at the forefront of AI incorporation for an engaging conversation that will touch on.</p> <p>*****<br/>Agenda:<br/>07:30 - arrival and networking<br/>07:50 - panel kick off<br/>08:30 - panel Q&amp;A<br/>09:00 - more networking (and anyone who needs to head off can leave)<br/>09:30 - close</p> <p>*****<br/>Speaker BIO\'s:</p> <p>Anthony Tockar (Moderator):<br/>Anthony Tockar is director and cofounder at Verge Labs, a new type of AI company focused on the applied side of machine learning. A jack-of-all-trades, he has worked on problems across insurance, technology, telecommunications, loyalty, sports betting and even neuroscience. He qualified as an actuary, then moved into data science, completing an MS in Analytics at the prestigious Northwestern University.</p> <p>After hitting the headlines with his posts on data privacy at Neustar, he returned to Sydney to practice as a data scientist and cofounded the Minerva Collective, a not-for-profit focused on using data for social good, as well as multiple meetup groups. His key missions are to extend the reach and impact of data science to help people, and to assist Australian businesses to become more data driven.</p> <p>Sam Zheng (Panelist):<br/>Sam is Co-founder/CEO of Curious Thing - a voice-based AI interviewer for talent acquisition startup.
